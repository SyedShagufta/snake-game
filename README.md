## Learning Opportunity 🎯

This project serves as an excellent introduction to game development in Python. It utilizes the Turtle library, a beginner-friendly library for creating graphics and games. If you're new to Turtle, you can learn more about it [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).

Feel free to explore the code, tweak it, and enhance the game to suit your preferences. Happy gaming! 🐍🎮
